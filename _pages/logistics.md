#### Recitations

Recitations are usually given by TAs and their goal is to cover background material needed to understand the course, as well as to provide help for homeworks. You can control the material of the recitations every week by posting on Piazza the topics you wish to be discussed on friday's recitation. Take advantage of this privilege to better tailor the course to your needs. 
<!-- Since neither lectures nor recitations are recorded this semester, your physical presence is necessary for both, for you to optimize your learning experience. -->

### Communication

Piazza is intended for all announcements, general questions about the course, clarifications about assignments, student questions to each other, discussions about material, and so on.

We strongly encourage all students to participate in discussion, ask, and answer questions in class as well as through Piazza!

We strongly encourage all students to form reading groups for joint study of the papers and the materials, to make the semester more fun and more productive.
